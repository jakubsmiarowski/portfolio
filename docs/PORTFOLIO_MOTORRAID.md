I also supported users and admins in daily use of the CMS and troubleshooting registration and payment issues.
```

**Paragraph 3 – Stack and tools**
```
Stack: Meteor, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redux, tRPC, Tailwind CSS, styled-components. Infrastructure: Docker, DigitalOcean (app and Spaces for files), MongoDB Atlas. Day-to-day: backup/restore (mongodump/mongorestore), logs (docker-compose), SSL (nginx-proxy + Let's Encrypt), migrations (migrate-mongo), email integrations (Resend) and code fixes when needed.
```

**Paragraph 4 – Business context / outcome**
