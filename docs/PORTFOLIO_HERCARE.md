HerCare is a platform connecting patients with midwives and other perinatal specialists. It enables search by location and services, browsing profiles and reviews, booking appointments (at clinic, home or online) and online payment. Specialists manage their calendar, availability and receive payouts via Stripe. The app is a PWA, multilingual (PL/EN) and includes an admin panel (users, payouts, commission invoices).

## Body paragraphs (long description – paste as separate paragraphs, separated by blank lines)

**Paragraph 1 – problem and solution:**  
Pregnant women and new mothers often struggle to find a trusted midwife, doula or physiotherapist and to safely book appointments and pay. HerCare is a marketplace connecting patients with independent specialists: one place to search, compare profiles and reviews, book appointments and pay online.

**Paragraph 2 – features for both sides:**  
Patients browse specialist profiles (slug in URL, service descriptions, prices, addresses), add favourites, book appointments in their preferred slots and pay by card via Stripe. Specialists manage availability (including home visits), service offerings and addresses, approve or decline bookings, and receive payouts to their account (with 7-day hold and automatic platform commission). The admin panel covers user management, payouts, commission invoice generation and visit reports (PDF).

**Paragraph 3 – stack and project character:**  
The project was built from scratch by me. Tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Supabase (auth, Postgres, Storage, RLS), Stripe (payments and Connect for payouts), Resend (emails), next-intl (PL/EN), Tailwind, Radix UI, Serwist (PWA). The app is optimized for Vercel (CDN, cache, edge), has cron jobs (appointment validation, reminders, invoices), Sentry integration and is set up for Vercel Analytics. Currently in production (hercare.pl).
