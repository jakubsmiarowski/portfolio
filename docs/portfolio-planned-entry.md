Core features for a leading corporate event management platform

## Body paragraphs (separate with blank lines)

```
Planned helps companies organize corporate events – from offsites and workshops to client meetings. It connects event planners with venues and suppliers in one place. I designed and built many of the core features from the ground up.
```

```
Guest registration & RSVP: I built a flexible registration flow that adapts to each event. Guests can sign up, join a waitlist if the event is full, and book accommodation as part of the process. The system tracks who's coming, who's pending, and sends confirmation emails automatically – with a cutoff date so organizers know when registration closes.
```

```
Smart checklists: Instead of manually creating the same tasks for every event, organizers define rules (e.g. "when it's a conference in Berlin with 100+ guests, create these 5 tasks"). The system creates and assigns tasks automatically based on event type, location, budget and more. Team members get notified and can track due dates in one place.
```

```
Event agenda: A visual calendar where organizers build the schedule with drag-and-drop. Each slot has time, location, video call links – whatever the event needs. Once ready, the agenda can be published and shared with participants via a simple link.
```

```
Venue & vendor marketplace: I redesigned how planners find and compare venues, caterers and suppliers. Search and filters make it easy to shortlist options and add them to an event. The system handles the flow from first inquiry to final booking.
```

```
Behind the scenes, I also set up the email system that sends confirmations, reminders and notifications – keeping everyone in the loop without manual work.

## Quick summary for "Feature breakdown" (blocks like in the screenshot)

- **Block 1 (Problem & solution):** Organizing corporate events means juggling guest lists, limits and waitlists. I built an RSVP system that handles all of that – configurable forms, cutoff dates, waitlist and accommodation booking in one flow.
- **Block 2 (Functionality & impact):** Smart checklists that auto-create tasks based on event details. A visual, shareable agenda with drag-and-drop. A marketplace to search, compare and book venues and vendors – from first search to final booking.
- **Block 3 (Outcome):** A platform that helps companies and agencies run corporate events more smoothly, with less manual work and better visibility across the whole process.

You can shorten or expand any block depending on the space on the page.
